NOTE: C2 and C3 are the same... why??

Question for Aline - bouncing off the walls is breaking it?

There's no lateral force â€“ objects don't 'slip' past eachother. This must be a bug, no? All the particles are perfectly above on another, and the pressure forces only act in that direction

Am I doing viscosity correctly?
When I took out the -1 in pressure, it made more sense...
What is Q? In the condensed interactino force expressions
TODO: normalize forces again


Questions:

How to get the gradient? Is it what I see in polar coordintes on wolfram?
MAX_KERNAL_DISTANCE (h) is weird if it's < 1, but 1 seems large?
Calculate density should return a scalar, but we sum over the vector components?
Pressure: When something is on the same Y coordinate, they scoot away from eachother b/c the kernel is nonzero at 0 and 

I'm following the paper and using the mean of the two particles, rather than simply adding to one and subtracting from the other, b/c they have different densities ya?

What if density - restDensity < 0?
